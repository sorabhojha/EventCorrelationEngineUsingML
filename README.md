# EventCorrelationEngineUsingML
A machine learning project that detects unusual network slowdowns and pinpoints the Root cause. Layered network failure detection and root cause analysis pipeline using Isolation Forest and per-IGP modeling. Simulates DM telemetry, identifies anomalous failures, localizes the responsible hop, and correlates events for explainable RCA.
